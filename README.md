# IR_Driver

<!-- Designed by Allen Peters

There are two design in here

The Emitter V2 is a dual IR driver
If I recall, the simulation and part selection is targetting ~0.9A
Works with 2S lipo, 6AA or 6NiMh batteries and performance should be voltage independent

The 360 IR TX and RX design is based off the Emitter V2
It targets a lower current (~200mA?) and drives 8 TSAL 7400 LEDs in a 360 degree pattern
It also has 4 IR receivers, also for a 360 degree pickup pattern -->
